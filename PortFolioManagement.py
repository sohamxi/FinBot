                Continuously monitor and track real-time risk metrics for portfolio "{portfolio_id}" in the {market} market.
                
                Key risk metrics to capture:
                - Value at Risk (VaR)
                - Total and per-asset exposure
                - Portfolio volatility and standard deviation
                - Inter-asset correlations
                - Stress test outcomes
                
                Integration:
                - Connect to real-time market data feeds.
                - Update risk metrics dynamically.
                
                Store results as follows:

                Analysis guidelines:
                - Analyze historical price volatility and chart support/resistance levels.
                - Assess risk/reward ratios based on technical indicators.
                - Generate recommended levels with alternative scenarios as needed.
